## Original Program Using reexec

    ** Initialization Phase (init function):**
        - Registers a function (nsInitialisation) that sets up namespaces and runs the /bin/sh command.
        - Calls reexec.Init() to check if the program is being re-executed with a specific argument.

    ***Namespace Setup and Execution (nRun function):***
        - Creates a command to run /bin/sh.
        - Configures various namespaces (mount, UTS, IPC, PID, network, user) and user/group ID mappings.
        - Runs the command in the newly set up namespaces.

    ***Main Function:***
        - Checks if the program is running as root.
        - Uses reexec.Command("nsInitialisation") to re-execute the program with the argument "nsInitialisation".
        - This triggers the nsInitialisation function, which sets up namespaces and runs the command.

## Simplified Program Without reexec

    ***Main Function:***
        - Checks if the program is running as root.
        - Creates a command to run /bin/sh.
        - Configures various namespaces (mount, UTS, IPC, PID, network, user) and user/group ID mappings.
        - Runs the command in the newly set up namespaces.

## Detailed Differences

    **Re-execution Mechanism:**
        - The reexec-based program uses the reexec package to re-execute the binary with specific arguments, allowing for a clear separation between the initial execution context and the namespaced execution context.
        - The simplified program directly runs the /bin/sh command with the specified namespace configurations without re-execution.

    **Namespace Initialization Hook:**
        - In the reexec-based program, the namespace setup code (nsInitialisation) is registered and executed via the reexec mechanism, providing a clean and explicit initialization phase.
        - In the simplified program, the namespace setup and command execution are directly handled within the main function.

    **Code Structure and Separation of Concerns:**
        - The reexec-based program separates the namespace setup logic into a dedicated function (nRun) and uses the init function to handle re-execution logic.
        - The simplified program combines namespace setup and command execution logic within the main function, leading to a more straightforward but less modular approach.

    **Error Handling and Exiting:**
        Both programs handle errors in a similar manner by checking the result of cmd.Run() and exiting with an error message if the command fails.

## Summary

    The reexec-based program is more modular and leverages the reexec package to handle namespace initialization in a cleaner and more explicit manner. This approach allows for better separation of concerns and makes the code easier to maintain and extend. The simplified program, on the other hand, directly sets up namespaces and runs the command within the main function, which is simpler but less modular and flexible.
